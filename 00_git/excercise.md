# Exercises - Version Control with git
SS 2015
HU Berlin


1.	Get the course material

    0. *(optional)* Create a Github account and fork this repository
    1. clone this repository to your local folder

2. Go to the `01_introduction/` directory and create a new file in which you can save your notes. Let's call it `notes.md` and save something in it. If you use markdown syntax like:
  ```
  # Title
  ## Subtitle
  This is some text.
  ```
  you will get it formatted automatically on Github and many other places. Very handy!
3. add this file to the repo and commit it.
4. *(optional)* If you forked the repository previously you can now push it to your github accout.
