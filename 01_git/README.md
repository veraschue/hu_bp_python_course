# Version Control with Git

## Introduction

In the beginning of the course we will start with a little [introduction](https://github.com/fugufisch/hu_bp_python_course/blob/master/01_git/lecture.md) to Git

## Excercise

Do [this excercise](https://github.com/fugufisch/hu_bp_python_course/blob/master/01_git/exercise.md) to get your own copy of the course material.

## Don't Panic!
You will need to become familiar with using Git to get the most out of this course, but we will always be there to help you if you run into  trouble. We will try to introduce the main concept in the introductory lecture, and then repeat the main concepts in the parts of the course where they will become important.

Here you will find a list of resources to help you with using git.
